# Write a program to take a user age and
# let him know if he can go the club.
# 21

# Logic Building Formula

# Step 1
# i/p - age, int
# o / p - String (reuslt -> Can go to club or not.

# Step 2. Rough logic ( brute force)
"""
> 21 -> print can go
age < 21 -> print can't go

"""

# Step 3. write the logic
age = int(input("Enter the age\n"))

if age > 21:
# print("Yes, can go club")
    print("Yes, can go club")
else:
    print("No, can't go club")  # Tab to complete

# Step 4. Check for the edge cases.
# We should consider edge cases such as:
# Negative ages or extremely high values -> program will break.
# Non-numeric input - ABC
# Age which is valid. > 130

# Step 5. Optimize¡the code.
# Handle all the edges.
